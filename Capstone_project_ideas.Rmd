#Capstone Project Ideas

#Idea 1: Isle of Man Census 

##Potential client: Isle of Man Government
Issue:  In terms of Gross National Income, the Isle of Man is ranked in the Top 10 of international economies. Historically this success has been driven by the finance sector, however in recent years the government has succesfully provided support in diversifying the economy into areas such as online gaming, digital currencies and the space industry.

The 2016 Isle of Man census captured a decline in resident population for the first time in 30 years, decreasing from 84,497 to 83,314, or a reduction of 1.4%. This compares to an increase of 5% or above, year on year, for the previous 3 censuses.

Aim: In order to maintain a healthy economy the island needs to retain its resident population and ideally continue to encourage people to relocate there. This project would aim to identify key demographic groups that are leaving the island and what the reasons may be behind this. This would allow the government to take pro-active action in keeping the island's economy healthy.

There are a significant number of potential complimentary [datasets](https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/departments/cabinet-office/open-data/) which could be used to investigate this problem. For example, the earnings, inflation, retail prices index and property transactions datasets could be used.

#Idea 2: Bathing Water Quality

##Potential client: South West Water 
Issue: A new, more stringent EU directive came into force in the UK in March 2015. In preparation for this, South West Water completed Â£20 million of infrastructure investment along the south coast of England in 2014/15 with the aim of improving bathing (sea) water quality. South West Water need to ensure they are meeting their targets in improving the quality by comparing previous years of water quality with the post-infrastructure improvement water quality.

Aim: Determine whether major investments in infrastructure have resulted in a marked improvement in the bathing water quality since spring of 2015.

The bathing water quality is measured from early May through to the end of September each year, there are about 400 weekly sampling sites in England.

The Met Office provides access to [historical rainfall data](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadukp/) which would allow investigation into whether heavy periods of rainfall correspond to poor water quality on this stretch of coast.

#Idea 3: Crime in London

##Potential client: Safety conscious Londoners
Issue: There is no easily accessible way for Londonders to check whether an area is a hotspot for a certain type of crime. This may be in the context of choosing a location to live or checking before heading somewhere for a night out. 

Aim: Determine hotspots for crime in central London. Identify whether there are seasonal patterns in the type of crimes occurring and the locations where they occur, plus whether crime types and frequency are changing over time. A visual geographic representation of hotspots would allow the user to be more aware of the potential risks of their surroundings.

This crime and policing dataset is for street level crime and is available for the England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data is reported monthly annd is available from December 2010 to March 2017 at present. Crime data has the date truncated to record only the month and year, and location is only referencing the approximate location using 'anonymous' map points. This is to protect the privacy of victims.

#Obtaining Data
Ideas 2 and 3 both support using an API to acquire the data. The crime data API requires an area polygon to be used and a date range. Idea 1 is in excel spreadsheet format with supporting documentation in the form of a pdf report.
