##Capstone Project 
#Data Wrangling

The following packages were loaded in preparation for data wrangling: readr, dplyr, tidyr and lubridate.

They key data wrangling steps that were undertaken as part of this project were as follows:

* Use glimpse(crime11to17) to review variable names, variable types, and number of observations. This reveals there are 11 variables - 6 characters, 3 numerics (1 integer, 2 double precision) and 2 factors. There are 498,628 observations in total.

* Convert category and location_type to factor using as.factor().

* Several of the variables contained no useful data for a civilian user. The variables context, persistent_id, id and location_subtype were removed with select() and variable names for category and location_type were changed to crime_type and service respectively, to make the dataset clearer using rename().

* Checked columns for missing values using sapply(crime11to17, function(x) sum(is.na(x))). Only the outcome_status_category and outcome_status_date contain NA values and there is no plan to use these in the scope of the current project.

* Use the lubridate functions year() and month() to create new columns called year and month from the original 'month' variable which was in format y-m.

* Create dataframe for monthly crime statistics from 2011 to 2017. Abbreviate the crime_type into new variable called crime_abb to improve data visualisations using case_when() function nested within mutate(). The 'r group_by()' function is then used to sort by year, month and crime_abb. summarize() is used to get a count for each of the new groupings.

* Repeat process for annual crime statistics from 2011 to 2016, 2017 removed as only a partial year. 

* Create dataframe for seasonal crime numbers using case_when() to assign Spring (March to May), Summer (June to August), Autumn (September to November) or Winter (December to February) to new season variable. Removed Mar-2017 from analysis as not sufficient data to constitute a full season.

* Save dataframes created using saveRDS for loading into analysis section.
